I thought it would be nice to save my submitted queries for better review. They don't always match the given answer.

I cannot emphasize enough: there were times when the query I submitted gave the correct answer, matching the expected answer row-by-row, but the website would not count it as correct.

In the sql file provided by the website, I had an issue when importing on line 4126. The spacing was off, and it needs to be tab-delimited.
